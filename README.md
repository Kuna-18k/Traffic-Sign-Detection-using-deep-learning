# 🚘 Traffic Sign Detection with Deep Learning

Welcome to the **Traffic Sign Detection** project! This repository showcases a deep learning model built to **detect and classify traffic signs** from images, helping move one step closer to safer autonomous driving systems.

---

## 📖 About the Project

Traffic signs are essential for maintaining road safety. This project uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to automatically recognize and classify traffic signs from real-world images, trained on the **German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)** dataset.

---

## 🧾 Features

✨ Detect and classify 43 different types of traffic signs  
📊 Trained on 50,000+ labeled images  
📦 Easy-to-use, modular code structure  
💡 Built with modern deep learning practices  
📸 Can be extended for real-time detection

## 🗃️ Dataset Used

**📍 Name**: [GTSRB - German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark](https://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset)  
**📸 Images**: 50,000+  
**🔢 Classes**: 43 unique traffic sign categories  
**🖼️ Preprocessing**: Resized images to 32x32 or 64x64, normalization, augmentation
